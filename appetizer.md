#### Ingredients



* 2 ½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled
* 
* 1 cup vegetable oil for frying
* 
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 
* 1 teaspoon garlic salt
* 
* 1 teaspoon onion salt
* 
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 
* ½ cup water, or as needed



Step 1



* Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown.



Step 2



* Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).



Step 3



* While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.



Step 4



* Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time.



Step 5



* Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes.



Step 6



* Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate.



Step 7



* Serve hot and enjoy!
