# How to Make Chocolate Chip Cookies



Let’s walk through how to make chocolate chip cookies step-by-step, and don’t forget to watch the video.



### Make the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough



Step 1



* The first step in making these easy chocolate chip cookies to to combine the dry ingredients in a medium size bowl.
* When doing this, make sure to Measure the flour correctly. Be sure to use a measuring cup made for dry ingredients (NOT a pyrex liquid measuring cup). Then, measure flour by scooping it into a measuring cup and leveling it with a knife.



Step 2



* Cream together butter and sugars, make sure to soften the butter early by taking it out of the fridge at least two hours before baking so it’s ready to go when you need it. You can also warm it in the microwave for about 10 seconds, but be super duper careful not to melt it.



Step 3



* Once butter/sugar mixture is beaten well, add the eggs \& vanilla and beat to combine.



Step 4



* Add dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Then add the chocolate chips and beat until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.
* Use **LOTS** of chocolate chips. You want at least two gooey chocolate chips in every bite.



Step 4



* Once the cookie dough is finished, it’s time to portion and roll the dough. I know many people eyeball it when making cookies, however I highly recommend using a cookie scoop.



Step 5



* At this point you can either bake your dough or freeze it.



##### How To Freeze Cookie Dough



Since this chocolate chip cookie recipe makes so many cookies, I always make a full batch and freeze some. That way I have dough on hand for unexpected guests or whenever the cookie craving strikes.



I prefer to flash-freeze the cookie dough before putting it in an airtight container. To do this, roll the cookie dough into balls and space them out on a parchment lined baking sheet. Then put the baking sheet in the freezer for about 30 minutes, or until the dough slightly freezes.



Once the dough is slightly frozen, transfer the cookie dough balls to an airtight container or plastic bag and freeze for up to 2 months.



##### How to Bake Frozen Dough



There are two ways to bake frozen dough:



1. Thaw it first: I love having dough ready to go in the freezer for impromptu guests. When you want to bake them, remove the dough balls from the freezer, set them on a parchment-lined baking sheet and cover with a light cloth towel or napkin to let them thaw. Then, once they reach room temperature (after about 1-2 hours depending on the temperature of your kitchen) bake as directed in the recipe (at 375 degrees F). SO easy!
2. Bake from frozen: Place the dough on a parchment lined baking sheet. Then, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (**ONLY if you are baking the frozen dough**) and put the cookies in the oven in the beginning of the preheating time. (So put the cookies in the oven as you preheat it). Set the timer for 15 minutes and remove the cookies after 15 minutes. The top will look a little more brown than usual, but they will still taste amazing.
